<!-- about me -->
## A little about me
I am an aspriring software developer with interests in data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and human-technology interaction (amongst other topics). I first fell in love with technolgy while working as a Business Analyst for an aviation company here in Portland (OR). During my time there I was fortunate enough to experience the many facets of the company (engineering, finance, management, manufacturing, and production), all of which helped me understand key business drivers in order to develop an automated document management system using Microsoft Sharepoint, Outlook, and Adobe Sign *(it also complied with FAA requirements for pursuing Supplemental Type Certificates)*. *This was probably the most stressful yet thrilling time I've experienced while on the job*. Because of this experience, I am now studying Computer Science at Portland State University and aim to graduate in the spring term of 2022. *I previously studied economics, political science, and philosophy at Oregon State University and Dominican University of California, where I played 4 yrs of competetive lacrosse and won 4 conference championships*. TL/DR
